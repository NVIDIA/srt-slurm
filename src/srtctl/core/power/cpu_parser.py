"""Parses ``cpu-power-exporter`` ``/metrics`` bodies into CPU power readings.

The exporter resolves DCGM-vs-ACPI once at startup and only ever serves one
metric family for its process lifetime, so a scrape body should never
contain both. If it ever did, ACPI wins here: it reports the socket envelope
plus every component rail, while DCGM can only report the rails it has
fields for (1130 = ``cpu_rail``, 1132 = ``soc``; no envelope), so ACPI is
the more informative source when both exist.

DCGM bodies come in two shapes. Newer exporters label each sample with the
DCGM ``field_id`` it read; older ones publish only field 1130 with no label.
Both go through :func:`cpu_sample.dcgm_rail_readings`, so an unlabelled
sample is filed exactly like a labelled 1130.

Rail vocabulary comes from :mod:`srtctl.core.power.cpu_rails`; nothing here
knows a firmware label by name.
